# Generative AI 
This repo is adapted from the official [Generative AI on AWS repo]([https://github.com/data-science-on-aws/data-science-on-aws](https://github.com/generative-ai-on-aws/generative-ai-on-aws)) and adjusted to reflect the capabilities of AWS Learner Labs.

# Important! :warning::warning::warning:
‚ùó When asked to login to a Canvas account, you will need to create a new account. This is the AWS Canvas account, and will not be the same as your USD Canvas account.

- In AWS Learner Labs once you reach $50 all of your code will be automatically destroyed. In addition, AWS Learner Labs has occasional issues where your environment is not accessible.
- **Be sure that you are ALWAYS storing your code in GitHub. You will not be given extra time to complete an assignment due to your Learner Lab deleting your code.**
- In order to make it easy to complete labs and work on your project, it is highly reccomended that you follow the below process, and at the step where you will create a JupyterLab Space, create two (one for a `lab` one for a `project`. Be sure you are saving your work from the `project` JupyterLab Space to your own GitHub repository.

# Setup Instructions
Please follow the setup guide from the `labs` repo [here](https://github.com/MADS508/labs/blob/main/README.md)

But when you get to the Clone Repo step use:

`git clone -b main https://github.com/mads508/generative-ai-labs.git`

If you see an error like the following, just re-run the command again until it works:
```
fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
```
_Note:  Just re-run the command again until it works._
